Am I seriously thinking about making my content multilingual? What is the use of this? If we want to be successful, we have to choose a language and a platform through which we can reach many potential customers.

This is a huge step back. It's a lot of extra work and I'm sharing my lack of attention again. I hear the voice in my head and the countless business development advice courses I've attended. Not to mention my experience in IT.

But the more I think about it, the more sympathetic the idea seems. My problem right now is lag. In other words, there are small time outages in communication. We have already discussed the reason for this. Installing an extra channel really takes more time. And of course, to add an extra result cost.

## What is the value?

I will have to make a diagram here, about the continuation of the observability pattern. TODO. Well, what I want to say. What is the value of an idea that has no embodiment? The answer is simple. Nothing. Others don't necessarily know about it. They are even less willing to pay for it. And it is certain that we will not receive much more support from our group of friends, apart from a few pats on the back. (I hope you are luckier than that.)

What can cause the idea not to become reality? The information is in a slow knowledge base. In our brains. If we want to communicate this, we have to extract it somehow. But the information needs to be rephrased to conform to a communication protocol. This also has a cost. However, information does not go through one transformation and filter, but countless. And we haven't even opened our mouths.

Any of these can have such a high cost that it would be too tiring to get information through it. Or simply block the sharing of information. In IT, this concept is called a proxy. But you may know it in this situation as a comfort zone, a delegation, or something else that performs a similar task.

However, we assume that this is a piece of a small filter. The reality is that there are countless small filters in a row. Which creates a so-called proxy chain. And the information has to pass through all of them in order to produce an output.

## Optimization

So there are countless little filters in our heads that block the flow of information. What can be done about it? If you are expecting a miracle method and a miracle drug, unfortunately I have to disappoint you.

We cannot turn off all filters. But we can improve the existing ones. Some we can avoid. Or we can change their order. We can even speed them up.

What is the first step? Each filter must be identified. But not all! We won't find them all the first time anyway. If we find one, we can fix it. Let's say, by outsourcing or delegating your task. Or we create a new work process for it, that is, we build a pipeline for it.

- But that's a lot of added work. Why would this be faster? Or better? And how does this come to multilingual content?

These are very good questions. (They would be, if I didn't ask them for myself.) My problem is not with the existence of the information, but with the delivery of it. If you exclude a filter, the information is more likely to get through.

## Pipelines

If an idea can take shape in some form. From then on, it becomes a ToDo. And for ToDo's, you can create a work process so that it becomes something else. The individual tasks can be outsourced to others or optimized on it.

Therefore, the fact that I am translating my content into several languages is not a step back, but the beginning of a new work process. Let's release something. Then the product just needs to be translated into a more useful language.

And in the meantime, it is possible to identify additional proxies and, if there is a way, to outsource or develop them.

I would like to close this train of thought with one of my dear Father's sayings.

"Work should always be approached in such a way that others can access it."
