I have tried numerous times to explain what I do shortly. Somehow, it never worked out. Therefore, I won’t try to achieve that here, especially not on this website, which is precisely meant for me to write about it at length.

If I say I’m an entrepreneur who is a developer, understands various software architectural issues, but whose favorite area is cybersecurity, essentially a full stack developer but for the backend, you might rightly ask:
- I don't understand. What exactly do you do?

I am an entrepreneur. And I solve problems. That's why I founded [GoSecNinja OÜ](https://gosecninja.com), to help those in the digital world who need it. Not everyone needs a full-time, certified security expert. (I will explain this later) But a few useful insights can save us a lot of headaches.

If you want to know more, or if you are interested in working with me, you can find out the details on the [GoSecNinja Pricing page](https://gosecninja.com/docs/pricing/pricing/).

But for now, I can write that I plan
- Workshops where we discuss and try to solve various challenges of digital business.
- Consultations. Where we can discuss certain challenges or I can help move closer to a solution.
- Collaborative work is also an option, as some projects cannot be resolved in 8 hours.
