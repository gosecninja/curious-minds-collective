I decided to write a book about the relationship between mental health and cyberspace. Why about this? Because this is what I consider important in my life at the moment, and perhaps in this way, I can more easily convey what I have previously only attempted to express on a petal of a flower.

But how do I write a book? I've never persevered longer on a book topic. I only say this because this is not my first attempt at writing. I have heard, read and seen many tips on how to develop a book.

They are: let's guess your title first. Then let's write down what the key points are. Of course, who is the book for? We can even take "how to write" classes, etc...

What they achieved for me was that I stopped writing and producing content very quickly. So I try not to follow these advices.

- When the first version of my writing is ready, it will be about 200-250 pages. Ehh? Where did this number come from? Just because. This is such a large amount that I would also spend some money to read or learn from it.
- What will it contain? I don't quite know yet. For now, the following ideas arise in my mind: information security, information-based society, individual security, the impact of mental health on individual security, employee cooperation, founding small businesses, (cyber)security first business model, AI, gamification. And similar.
- How do I write? Totally public. As soon as I have an idea, I publish it on the site, and then I share it on other places.
- What if something is not related to the topic or I go beyond the scope? Since my goal is to let my imagination run wild, I don't care that much about it yet. The content will be edited before publication anyway. Then we will take care of the better collection.

This is also a gamification strategy that I would like to pass on. We are too busy with ToDos. We are struggling with what to do next. Instead, we could think about achievements. Who cares if we spent 100 hours in a game and collected 1 million gold? Nobody. But it suits us.

What if I don't get a new achievement today? Nothing. Tomorrow is also sunny.
When can we deal with a game? When we have time and energy for it. It is important that the process is enjoyable.

So what I am describing may not be understandable to everyone yet. I'm not surprised. But I will do my best to make the process followable. And if you find the content useful, I will also help you in how you can support me in my work.
